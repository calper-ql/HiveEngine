A game/simulation that uses this engine: https://github.com/calper-ql/MilkywayVR

HiveEngine is my personal simulation/game engine. It provides some basic tools to create a space game.

HiveEngine offers a Bounding Volume Hierarchy and a Custom Quad-tree for celestial object generation.

More on how to use and docs will be updated soon (hopefully...)
